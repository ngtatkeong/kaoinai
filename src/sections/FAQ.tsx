    question: 'What is KaoinAI and how is it different from legacy tools?',
    answer:
      'KaoinAI is an all-in-one AI data intelligence platform engineered specifically for SMEs. Unlike legacy tools (Collibra, Informatica, Alation) that cost $100k–$1M+* and take 6 months* to deploy, KaoinAI connects in minutes*, uses AI to auto-generate rules and metadata, and costs a fraction of enterprise software.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does KaoinAI connect to our databases? Is our data secure?',
    answer:
      'KaoinAI operates on a read-only metadata architecture. We do NOT replicate or store your raw database rows on our servers. All connections use TLS 1.3 encryption with options for VPC peering and IP whitelisting. KaoinAI is built according to SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 security standards.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which databases, data warehouses, and ERPs are supported?',
    answer:
      'KaoinAI is ERP-agnostic. We provide native connectors for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle NetSuite, SAP, Salesforce, and Supabase. Custom JDBC/ODBC connectors are also available.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the PII Detection and compliance workflow work?',
    answer:
      'KaoinAI scans column names and sample data distributions using AI classification models to detect sensitive attributes (names, IC/NRIC, passport numbers, emails, payment data, health records). It flags compliance violations across GDPR, PDPA, HIPAA, and CCPA, and recommends automated masking rules.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does KaoinAI tie DPIA and Data Inventory (RoPA) directly to database tables?',
    answer:
      'Unlike legacy privacy tools that store compliance records in disconnected spreadsheets or survey portals, KaoinAI anchors DPIA risk assessments and statutory Data Inventories directly to the physical database tables, schemas, and columns where PII resides. If an engineer migrates a schema or adds a new sensitive column in Postgres, MySQL, or Snowflake, KaoinAI automatically flags DPIA drift and updates your Singapore PDPA & GDPR Article 30 Data Inventory in real time.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do we need data engineers or SQL experts to use KaoinAI?',
    answer:
      'No! KaoinAI features natural language interfaces ("Ask Data in Plain English"), AI-suggested validation rules, and automated dbt model generators. Non-technical compliance officers, business analysts, and fractional CTOs can manage the platform with ease.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a Free Trial, and does it apply to both Cloud and On-Premises?',
    answer:
      'Our 14-day free trial is available exclusively for self-hosted On-Premises or Private VPC deployments (Docker or Helm in your own AWS/GCP VPC or local server). Because On-Premises runs entirely within your infrastructure with zero external data egress and zero cloud hosting overhead for KaoinAI, you can test on your real schemas with complete security and no credit card required. Managed Cloud (SaaS) environments require dedicated cluster provisioning and compute, and therefore do not include a self-serve free trial (available via paid plans or our $0 Founding Cohort slots). At the end of your 14-day on-prem trial, you can transition smoothly to an annual on-prem software license or migrate to Managed Cloud.',
